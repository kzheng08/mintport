# Structuring your API reference

GitBook does more than just render your OpenAPI spec. It lets you customize your API reference for better clarity, navigation, and branding.

### Split operations across multiple pages

To keep your documentation organized, GitBook can split your API operations into separate pages. Each page is generated from a tag in your OpenAPI spec. To group operations into a page, assign the same tag to each operation:

```yaml
paths:
  /pet:
    put:
      tags:
        - pet
      summary: Update an existing pet.
      description: Update an existing pet by Id.
      operationId: updatePet
```

### Reorder pages in your table of contents

The order of pages in GitBook matches the order of tags in your OpenAPI tags array:

```yaml
tags:
  - name: pet
  - name: store
  - name: user
```

### Nest pages into groups

To build multi-level navigation, use `x-parent` (or `parent`) in tags to define hierarchy:

```yaml
tags:
  - name: everything
  - name: pet
    x-parent: everything
  - name: store
    x-parent: everything
```

The above example will create a table of contents that looks like:

```
Everything
├── Pet
└── Store
```

If a page has no description, GitBook will automatically show a card-based layout for its sub-pages.

### Customize page titles, icons, and descriptions

You can enhance pages with titles, icons, and descriptions using custom extensions in the tags section. All [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/search) are supported via `x-page-icon`.

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
tags:
  - name: pet
    # Page title displayed in table of contents and page
    -x-page-title: Pet
    # Icon shown in table of contents and next to page title
    -x-page-icon: dog
    # Description shown just above the title
    -x-page-description: Pets are amazing!
    # Content of the page
    description: Everything about your Pets
```

### Build rich descriptions with GitBook Blocks

Tag description fields support GitBook markdown, including [advanced blocks](../../creating-content/blocks/) like tabs:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
---
tags:
  - name: pet
    description: |
      Here is the detail of pets.

      <Tabs>
<Tab title="Dog">
Here are the dogs
</Tab>

      <Tab title="Cat">
Here are the cats
</Tab>

      <Tab title="Rabbit">
Here are the rabbits
</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

### Highlight schemas

You can highlight a schema in a GitBook description by using GitBook markdown. Here is an example that highlights the “Pet” schema from the “petstore” specification:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
---
tags:
  - name: pet
      description: |
          {% openapi-schemas spec="petstore" schemas="Pet" grouped="false" %}
              The Pet object
          {% endopenapi-schemas %}
```

### Document a webhook endpoint

GitBook also supports documenting webhook endpoints when using OpenAPI 3.1.

You can define your webhooks directly in your OpenAPI file using the `webhooks` field, which works similarly to `paths` for regular API endpoints:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
---
openapi: 3.1.0 # Webhooks are available starting from OpenAPI 3.1

webhooks:
  newPet:
    post:
      summary: New pet event
      description: Information about a new pet in the system
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pet"
      responses:
        "200":
          description: Return a 200 status to indicate that the data was received successfully
```
