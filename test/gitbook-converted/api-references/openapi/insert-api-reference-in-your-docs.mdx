# Insert API reference in your docs

GitBook allows you to automatically generate pages related to the endpoints you have in your OpenAPI spec. These pages will contain OpenAPI operation blocks, allowing you and your visitors to test your endpoints and explore them further based on the information found in the spec.

<Check>
Endpoints added from your spec will continue to be updated anytime your spec is updated. See the [Update your specification](add-an-openapi-specification#update-your-specification) section for more info.

### Automatically create OpenAPI pages from your spec

After you’ve [added your OpenAPI spec](add-an-openapi-specification), you can generate endpoint pages by inserting an **OpenAPI Reference** in the table of contents of a Space.
