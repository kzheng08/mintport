# Cards

You can use cards to create a visually pleasing page layout, combining text and images in a grid. They’re ideal for building landing pages or displaying any other content in a non-linear way.

You can adjust [switch between medium or large cards](cards#card-size) and link them to the relevant resources.

### Example of a card

### Adding links 

Hover over a card and open its **Options menu** ![The Options menu icon in GitBook](../../.gitbook/assets/25_01_10_options_light.svg). Here you can add a target link, so users can jump directly to a location when they click the card.

<Check>
When creating cards, we recommend you use **target links instead of hyperlinks**. With a target link, your readers can click anywhere on the card to access the linked URL.

### Adding images

Hover over a card and open its **Options menu** ![The Options menu icon in GitBook](../../.gitbook/assets/25_01_10_options_light.svg). Here you can add a cover image to your card. Alternatively, just click the **Add cover image** option on the card itself.

This will open the **Select file** modal. Here you can drag and drop a new image into this, or use an image file you’ve previously uploaded to your space.

#### Adding images for dark mode

You can also add cover images that will only show in dark mode.

To do this, open the card’s **Options menu** ![](../../.gitbook/assets/25_01_10_options_light.svg) and choose **Cover** > **Edit cover** > **Add cover for dark mode**. This will open the **Select file** modal, where you can drag and drop a new image or select a previously-uploaded image.

#### Choosing the right image size

GitBook will automatically crop landscape images to a 16:9 ratio on desktop and mobile. If the images you upload are portrait or have a 1:1 ratio, they will be cropped to 16:9 on desktop and display as square or portrait on mobile.

To keep things consistent across desktop and mobile, we recommend uploading all the images for your cards in a 16:9 format (e.g. 1920px x 1080px).

If you want your cards to adapt their layout depending on the screen size, we’d recommend uploading images with a 1:1 ratio, and the content of your image centered.

### Changing the size of cards

You can select the card size by opening the **Options menu** ![The Options menu icon in GitBook](../../.gitbook/assets/25_01_10_options_light.svg) to the left of your card block. The **Medium** option creates three cards in one horizontal line, while the **Large** option shows two larger cards on each line.

<Note>
You can make card blocks [span the full width of your window](./#full-width-blocks) by clicking on the **Options menu** ![The Options menu icon in GitBook](../../.gitbook/assets/25_01_10_options_light.svg) next to the block and choosing **Full width**.
