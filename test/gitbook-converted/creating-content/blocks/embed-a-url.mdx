# Embedded URLs

To add an embedbed URL, simply paste the link of the content you want to embed and hit `Enter`.

<Note>
**Note:** The content you want to embed must be publicly available in order for GitBook to access the file. For example, when embedding a Google doc the share settings must be set to _Anyone with the link_.
