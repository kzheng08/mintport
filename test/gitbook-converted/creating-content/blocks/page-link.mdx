# Page links

Page link blocks are the best way create relations between different pages within your content. Page links stand out on the page as they fill their own block — compared to a hyperlink added to some text.&#x20;

### Example of page link block

The links below point to [blocks](./) and [inline content](../formatting/inline):

[blocks](/creating-content/blocks/)

[inline](/creating-content/formatting/inline)

## Representation in Markdown

```markdown
[blocks](/creating-content/blocks/)
```
