# Version control

You can easily monitor all the changes people have made to your content using to the **Version history** side panel.

### Version history 

In the Version history of a space, you can see a list of all the actions that changed the content within it. These include:

* When someone made [live edits](../collaboration/live-edits) to the space.
* When someone merged a [change request](../collaboration/change-requests/).
* When someone performed a [Git Sync](../getting-started/git-sync/) operation.

### View historical versions of content

To view past versions of your content and see the changes that were made, click the **Version history** ![The Version history icon in GitBook](../.gitbook/assets/25_01_10_history_icon_light.svg) button in the [space header](../resources/gitbook-ui/#space-header), or open the **Actions menu** ![The Actions menu icon in GitBook](../.gitbook/assets/25_02_04_actions_horizontal_1.svg) next to the space or change request title and choose **Version history**.

Click on any item in the list to see how your content looked at the point this change was made. This is very similar to how you view [change requests](../collaboration/change-requests/).

### Show changes

When you are viewing an old version of your content, you can choose to highlight the differences between the old and current content — similar to [diff view in a change request](../collaboration/change-requests/#diff-mode).

To enable or disable this, use the **Show changes** toggle at the bottom of the **Version history** side panel.

With show changes enabled, content that has changed will be highlighted by an icon on the left of its content block.

### Viewing historical published versions

If you're investigating the version history of a published space, you can also view previews of what the previous versions looked like in the published context (i.e. what the end user would see).

You can do this by:

<Steps>
<Step>
From the version history side panel, select the revision
</Step>

<Step>
Copy the ID at the end of the URL
</Step>

<Step>
Add it at the end of your published docs URL as `/~/revisions/<id>`
</Step>
</Steps>

### Roll back to a previous version

Rolling back allows you to revert a space’s content to the way it was at a previous point in time. This is helpful if you’ve accidentally made a breaking change or deleted content and need to quickly get back to a previous version of the space.

To roll back to a previous version of your space, hover over the version in the side panel, click the **Actions button** ![The Actions menu icon in GitBook](../.gitbook/assets/25_01_10_actions_icon_light.svg) and select **Rollback**.
