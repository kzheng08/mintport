# Content configuration

If you’d like to configure Git Sync further, you can add a `.gitbook.yaml` file at the root of your repository to tell GitBook how to parse your Git repository.

```yaml title=".gitbook.yaml"
root: ./

​structure:
  readme: README.md
  summary: SUMMARY.md​

redirects:
  previous/page: new-folder/page.md
```

### Root

The path to lookup for your documentation defaults to the root directory of the repository. Here’s how you can tell GitBook to look into a `./docs` folder:

```yaml title=".gitbook.yaml"
root: ./docs/
```

<Warning>
**All other options that specify paths will be relative to this root folder**. So if you define root as `./docs/` and then `structure.summary` as `./product/SUMMARY.md`, GitBook will actually look for a file in `./docs/product/SUMMARY.md`.‌
</Warning>

### ​Structure‌ 

The structure accepts two properties:‌

* **`readme`**: Your documentation’s first page. Its default value is `./README.md`
* **`summary`**: Your documentation’s table of contents. Its default value is `./SUMMARY.md`

The value of those properties is a path to the corresponding files. The path is relative to the “root” option. For example, here’s how you can tell GitBook to look into a `./product` folder for the first page and summary:

```yaml title=".gitbook.yaml"
structure:
  readme: ./product/README.md
  summary: ./product/SUMMARY.md
```

<Warning>
When Git Sync is enabled, **remember not to create or modify readme files** through GitBook's UI. The readme file should be managed exclusively in your GitHub/GitLab repository to avoid conflicts and duplication issues.
</Warning>

### Summary‌ 

The `summary` file is a Markdown file (`.md`) that should have the following structure:

```markdown title="./SUMMARY.md"
‌# Summary​

## Use headings to create page groups like this one​

* [First page’s title](page1/README)
    * [Some child page](page1/page1-1)
    * [Some other child page](part1/page1-2)

* [Second page’s title](page2/README)
    * [Some child page](page2/page2-1)
    * [Some other child page](part2/page2-2)

## A second-page group​

* [Another page](another-page)
```

Providing a custom summary file is optional. By default, GitBook will look for a file named `SUMMARY.md` in your `root` folder if specified in your config file, or at the root of the repository otherwise.

If you don’t specify a summary, and GitBook does not find a `SUMMARY.md` file at the root of your docs, GitBook will infer the table of contents from the folder structure and the Markdown files below.‌

<Note>
The summary markdown file is **a mirror of the** **table of contents** of your GitBook space. So even when no summary file is provided during an initial import, GitBook will create one and/or update it whenever you update your content using the GitBook editor.

Because of this, it’s not possible to reference the same Markdown file twice in your `SUMMARY.md` file, because this would imply that a single page lives at two different URLs in your GitBook space.
</Note>

#### Table of contents (sidebar) titles 

If you want your pages to have a different title in the table of contents sidebar than on the page itself, you can define an optional **page link title** in your `SUMMARY.md` file.

If you’re using Git Sync, the page link title is set on the page link:

```markdown title="./SUMMARY.md"
# Summary

* [Page main title](page.md "Page link title")
```

The text inside the quotes (`"Page link title"`) will be used:

* In the table of contents (sidebar)
* In the pagination buttons at the bottom of each page
* In any relative links you add to that page

Page link titles are optional — if you don’t manually add one, GitBook will use the page’s standard title everywhere by default.

### ​Redirects 

Redirects allow you to define redirects in your `.gitbook.yaml` configuration file. The path is relative to the “root” option. For example, here’s how you can tell GitBook to redirect users accessing a past url `/help` to a new url `/support`

```yaml title=".gitbook.yaml"
root: ./

redirects:
  help: support.md
```

<Note>
Redirects you define in a space’s configuration file are scoped to the corresponding space. We recommend creating [site redirects](../../publishing-documentation/site-redirects) for most cases as they apply to the whole site, across spaces.
</Note>

<Warning>
With Git, when a file is moved many times, the file is removed and a new one is created. This makes it impossible for GitBook to know that a folder has been renamed, for example. Make sure to double-check and add redirects where needed.
</Warning>
