# Adaptive content

{/* gitbook: include "../../.gitbook/includes/ultimate-hint.md" %} */}

When a user visits your site, you may already know things about them — such as who they are, which plan they’re subscribed to, and which features they have access to.

Adaptive content helps to build a tailored documentation experience based on who is reading.

<Note>
Adaptive content is slightly different from [authenticated access](../authenticated-access/), although they can work together.&#x20;

While authenticated access allows you to protect your docs through a login, adaptive content customizes published material based on various authentication methods — including authenticated access or those from your own app.
</Note>

### How it works

Adaptive content works in one of two ways:

1. Passing data from your app to GitBook
2. Passing data from authenticated access

When a user visits your sites, we call the data they bring with them their “claims” — basically data that helps to identify a user. These claims are controllable by you — the site author — and can be used through the GitBook editor to show or hide different pages, variants, and sections in your docs.
