You can pass visitor data to your docs through URL query parameters. Below is an overview of the method:

### Query parameters

To pass data to GitBook through URL parameters, you’ll need to pass the data in the URL in the format `visitor.<prop>`.

For example:

```url
https://docs.acme.org/?visitor.language=fr
```

This will allow you to use these claims in the [condition editor](../adapting-your-content#working-with-the-condition-editor) under the unsigned object:

```javascript
visitor.claims.unsigned.language === "fr"
```

<Warning>
Data passed through query parameters must be defined in your visitor schema through an [unsigned](https://gitbook.com/docs/publishing-documentation/adaptive-content/enabling-adaptive-content#setting-unsigned-claims) object. Additionally, query parameters can be easily changed by the visitor and are best suited for non-sensitive information.
</Warning>
