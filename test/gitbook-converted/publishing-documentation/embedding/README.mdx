# Embed in your product

The Docs Embed is a powerful window into your product knowledge that you can add to any product or website. Users can ask their questions to the [GitBook Assistant](../gitbook-ai-assistant) or browse your docs directly, without leaving your product. You can open the Embed with a button, put it in any component you want, or control it completely programatically.

## Overview

The Docs Embed consists of multiple tabs that get shown automatically, depending on your site's configuration:

* **Assistant**: The [GitBook Assistant](../gitbook-ai-assistant) - an AI-powered chat interface to help users find answers
* **Docs**: A browser for navigating your documentation site

You can customize and override the default configuration with custom actions, tools, suggested questions, [Authenticated Access](../authenticated-access/), and more.

## Get started

<Steps>
<Step>
**Prerequisites**

Before embedding your docs, ensure:

1. **Your docs are published** and accessible at a URL (e.g., `https://docs.company.com`).
2. **You have retrieved the embed script URL** from your site settings (Settings → AI & MCP → Embed).

<Note>
If you want to use the Assistant tab, [GitBook Assistant must be enabled](../gitbook-ai-assistant) for your docs site (Settings → AI & MCP).
</Note>
</Step>

<Step>
**Implementation**

Pick the approach that matches your setup:

:code:**Standalone script tag**Drop in a &#x3C;script> tag for the fastest setup, then customize its appearance[script.md](implementation/script.md):box:**Node.js/NPM**Install via NPM for server-side rendering or build-time control[nodejs.md](implementation/nodejs.md):react:**React component**Use prebuilt React components for seamless integration[react.md](implementation/react.md)

<Note>
