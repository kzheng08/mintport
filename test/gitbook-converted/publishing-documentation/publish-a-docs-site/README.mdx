# Publish a docs site

Once you’ve finished writing, editing, or importing your content, you can publish your work to the web as a docs site. Your docs will be published on the web and available to your selected audience.

The content on your site comes from [spaces](../../creating-content/content-structure/space) in your organization. When you create a new docs site, you can create a new space, or link an existing one.

### Create a docs site

To create a docs site, click the plus **+** icon next to Docs site in the sidebar to launch the docs site wizard.

Give your site a name, choose a starting point for your content, and select whether you want to publish your site now or later.

If you already have content in a space that you would like to use, you can create a docs site directly from that space by opening the space and clicking **Share** in the top-right corner of the window. Then choosing **Publish as a docs site** from the share modal.

### Publish a docs site

By default, your site will be published publicly. You can change your site’s visibility in your [site’s settings](../site-settings).

There are three primary options to choose from when publishing your site:

### Delete or unpublish a docs site

To delete a docs site, you’ll need to open your site’s dashboard, then open [**Site settings**](../site-settings#delete-site) from the top-right corner.

### Site editing permissions

Docs sites inherit the editing permissions from the [spaces](../../creating-content/content-structure/space) linked to them.

You can view all the permissions set for users with access to the docs site from the permissions modal from the docs site’s **Overview** page. You’ll also see which space the user’s permission was inherited from. If you’d like to change the permission settings, open the space, then click **Share**. Here you can edit the permissions from a modal.

Users with **Administrator** or **Creator** permissions on _any_ space linked to a specific docs site will have full access permissions for the site. This means that they’ll be able to control any of the publishing and customization settings.

Users with **Reviewer**, **Editor**, **Commenter**, or **Reader** permissions on any space linked to a specific site will get read-only permissions. This means they will see the docs site in your organization, but won’t be able to access any of its settings.
