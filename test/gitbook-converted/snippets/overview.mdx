# Overview

<Warning>
The Snippets feature is no longer maintained in GitBook and is subject to change. We recommend to structure your content in a [space](../creating-content/content-structure/space) instead.
</Warning>

Technical knowledge is best when it’s accessible, and shared. In GitBook, snippets make it easy to collect knowledge from your favorite tools, while content insights help you keep your content up to date effortlessly.
